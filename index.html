  <p id= "tribute-info"> Some people are born to code and few others think They’re Not Meant to Code, and I was one of them too. One of the top reasons why people are afraid of learning a programming language is that they think it's too difficult to learn. While programming terminologies can be intimidating, they're often easy to learn. Once you understand the fundamentals, it's easier to catch up.
Even a tyro needs a better tool to perform.
 So I looked for the best resources on the internet and found freeCodeCamp. Thankfully, it did really changed my world filled with fear and failures towards the world of coding!
